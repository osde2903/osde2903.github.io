      That might all sound bad, but think of this as the end of one chapter and the beginning of another!
      You are in a time of transition, and it's best to embrace it even if it's painful. And it might be.
      But everything good is worth working for, and you're ready. </p>

      feeling passionate, but it isn't strictly about romantic relationships and intense interpersonal bonds. One basic meaning
      of this card is that you may come across a divergence you dare not miss, no matter the difficulty, even if it is against
      your chosen path. Be on the lookout for this opportunity, and don't automatically take the easy road. Think things over
      before you come to a decision. Perhaps it's time to take a leap of faith.</p>
