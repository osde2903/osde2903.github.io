      I am a United States Marine Corps veteran currently using my G.I. Bill to study Information Science
        at the University of Colorado Boulder. The Marine Corps gave me invaluable life experience however
        I always knew I wanted to attend school full time.
        Over the last few years my new passions have been Information Science and UX design. I love learning
        new ways I can manipulate data to achieve an overall goal. As well as redesigning identities in order
        to help revamp older systems.
